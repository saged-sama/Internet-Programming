                  The journey of the Department of Computer Science and Engineering started in a bright morning of September 1992. 
                  It was a brainchild of Dr. M. Lutfor Rahman, a visionary Professor of the Department of Applied Physics and 
                  Electronics, University of Dhaka, who felt the urge to come up with an academic department to tackle the 
                  snowballing necessity for computer scientists and IT specialists. In spite of a humble beginning, the department, 
                  then known as Department of Computer Science, attracted the very best minds of the nation and soon 
                  accumulated a star studded faculty roster as well as the brightest of the students.
                </p>

                <p className="text-justify mb-6">
                  The department started with a single classroom offering M.Sc. degree in Computer Science under the Faculty of 
                  Science. In 1994, three year B.Sc. Honors program was introduced which was upgraded to four year B.Sc. Honors 
                  program in 1997. It is the first department in the Faculty of Science to introduce the four year B.Sc. program in the 
                  University of Dhaka. In 2004, the name of the department was changed to Computer Science and Engineering, 
                  leading to its inclusion in the freshly formed Faculty of Engineering and Technology in 2008. In 2010, the four point 
                  grading system was introduced in the Faculty of Engineering and Technology.

                <p className="text-justify mb-6">
                  Initially, the department started with 20 students in the M.Sc. program in 1992 and then started B.Sc. (Hons) program 
                  from 1995 with 21 students. With the increasing demand of Computer Science graduates for the nation, University of 
                  Dhaka increased the number of seats for B.Sc. (Hons) program to 60 in 1995. So far, 25 batches have completed 
                  their undergraduate studies and 5 batches are currently pursuing their degrees from the department. In addition, 31 
                  batches have completed the graduate study (MSc/ MS) programs and currently 1 batch is continuing their MS 
                  coursework/ research. Although only 11 researchers completed PhD from this department, currently there are 4 PhD 
                  students pursuing towards their degrees in addition to 1 MPhil students.

                  In total, the department has 39 active teachers, 19 of whom have already earned their PhD degrees. Currently,14
