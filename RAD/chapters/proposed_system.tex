\chapter{Proposed System}
\section{Overview}
The project is the development of  E Lib that aims to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the library management process. The software will be used by the library staff and admin to manage books, users, borrowing, returning, notifications, and generate reports and analytics. The objectives of the project are to automate and streamline the library management process, reduce human error, and improve the overall user experience. The project scope includes the development of the software, testing, and implementation.

\section{Functional Requirements}

\input{tables/functional_requirement}

\section{Non Functional Requirements}
\subsection{Usability}
The software should have a clear and user-friendly interface, with intuitive navigation and easy-to-use controls..The software should be consistent in its layout and design, to avoid confusion and make it easier to use.The software should allow for quick and easy data entry and retrieval, reducing the time needed for administrative tasks.The software should have a search function that is easy to use and returns accurate and relevant results.

\subsection{Reliability}
The software should be available for use at all times.The software should have automatic data backups to prevent data loss in case of system failure.The software should be able to recover from errors or crashes without losing any data or corrupting the database.The software should be able to handle concurrent users without performance degradation.The software should be regularly updated and maintained to ensure stability and reliability.

\subsection{Performance}
The system should respond to user input within 2 seconds or less.The system should be able to handle a minimum of 100 concurrent users without experiencing any performance degradation.The system should be able to process book checkout and return transactions within 5 seconds or less.The system should be able to handle at least 10,000 book records without experiencing any slowdown.The system should be able to handle search queries for books by various parameters (author, title, caategory,subcategory) within 3 seconds or less.

\subsection{Supportability}

The system should be easy to install and configure, with clear documentation and installation guides provided to the customer.The system should be modular and easy to maintain, with clear separation of concerns between different components and modules.The system should be designed to minimize downtime and provide automatic backups and recovery options.The system should be designed to work with different hardware and software environments, with clear guidelines and recommendations provided for the customers.

\subsection{Implementation}
The software should be developed using a high-level programming language,  Python, Django and JS.The software should use a database management system (DBMS) to store and retrieve data efficiently. The preferred DBMS for the project is MySQL.The software should be developed using version control software, such as Git, to enable collaboration and manage code changes effectively.
\subsection{Scalability}
The system should be able to handle a minimum of 1000 users concurrently without significant degradation in performance.The response time for critical transactions should not exceed 3 seconds, even under peak load conditions.he database should be designed to handle a large volume of data, with indexing and partitioning strategies to optimize performance.

\subsection{Security}
The system should have a secure login process for all users, including admin and library staff. The login should require a unique username and password for each user.The system should have role-based access control to ensure that users only have access to the functions and data that they are authorized to use.The system should ensure the privacy and confidentiality of user data, such as personal information, borrowing history.The system should have regular backups of all data and implement a disaster recovery plan to ensure data can be recovered in the event of a breach or system failure.The system should maintain an audit trail of all user activities, including logins, transactions, and changes to data, to aid in detecting and investigating security breaches.

\subsection{Testability}
The software must be designed in a modular fashion so that individual components can be easily tested in isolation.Testing and debugging will have to be conducted to ensure maximum reliability of our system.

\subsection{Maintainability}
The product should be modular and well-structured, with clear separation of concerns, to make it easier to understand and modify.
The code should be well-documented to make it easier to maintain and update.The product should be designed with future changes in mind, so that new features and functionality can be added with minimal impact on existing code.

\section{System Model}
\subsection{Scenarios}

\subsubsection{Create new user account}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Admin can create new user account.
    \item Admin gives different information for the account.
    \item Only Admin can access create new user section.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Member Maintenance}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Librarian and staffs who have user account maintain the member of the library.
    \item User can update ,delete the information of the member.
    \item Book lending facilities for the member also maintain by the users.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Book Management}

\begin{itemize}
    \item User can add books according to their section,subsection and categories.
    \item User can filter the books on basis of category.
    \item user can update quantity or availability of the books.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Book Transaction}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Users handle the book transaction section.
    \item Users update the information like status,borrowing date,returning date etc related to each transaction
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Book Return}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Users make sure that the book must be returned in the selected date.
    \item After returning book users update the information. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{User interface}

\subsubsection{Home Page}
The Home page shows statistics of all the options for the system which includes Home,Category,Sub Category,Books,Students,Borrowing Transaction,User etc. There will be a menu bar above, which will show the options.

\subsubsection{Menu Bar}
Admin can be able to access all of the sections of menu-bar.But Librarian and other staffs can't access user section part. In this specific section , new user for the software can be added

\subsubsection{Categories}
In this section the books will arrange according to their category.The description and the date from when the book has been added will be provided.Here will be the action part in which the users can update,remove or view the books.Here Users can add the books by filling up the information about the book and the searching option will 
also available in this page.

\subsubsection{Subcategories}
It will be same as categories page.The main deference is it will provide the information more specific for the users.All the options which are available in the Categories page will also be available in this page.

\subsubsection{Books}
In this section books will be displayed with their category/subcategory,title,id added date ,status, action etc.Book searching option will be available in this section.User can add new book ,update the information ,remove and view the book.

\subsubsection{Member}
This section will provide the information of the library member.The information like name,ID,Added date will be available.Users can add or remove the member if they want.There will be update or view option for editing or viewing member's information.Searching option will also available.

\subsubsection{Transaction}
In this section users can add the information of borrowing and returning book.Users will keep the record of the members who will borrow or return the book with their name,id and the book name which will be transacted.

\subsubsection{Create New Account}
Admin can only access this section.Admin can add new account.Other users (Librarian,Stuffs) won't have the access to create new account.


\subsubsection{Software Interface}
The project is a web based application. Hence it will need a working web browser and windows OS. The app can be kept in the pc's memory and can be runned locally.

\subsubsection{Hardware Interface}
The app will need the keyboard/mouse to interfere with the user.
